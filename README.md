# SVHN
For the capstone project, you will use the SVHN dataset. This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in all, and is a harder dataset than MNIST as the numbers appear in the context of natural scene images. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.  Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu and A. Y. Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning". NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011. Your goal is to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes.
